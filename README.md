# NVIDIA Jetson Object Detection
Object Detection on Jetson TX2
A subset of a project to do object detection (toy detection really) on a Jetson TX2 powered Lego Robot. For example, here are samples of the two classes of objects the model included in this repo can detect :<br>
<br>
Insert IMAGE 1 - class = Similar to lego blocks <br>
Insert IMAGE 2 - class = Rubik Cube <br>

See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8ZtLOhuymo) for an actual example of a video recording of what it's doing. The idea is that this piece of software is to provide a robot the coordinates so that the robot can actually pick up and move these objects around.

Outstanding issues:

- [ ] Tracking Stability :
    - [ ] Find a way to remove dangling processes (maybe garbage collecting some unused queues...???)
    - [ ] sometimes, when I remove objects, it doesn't get removed... maybe it think it's tracked... need to refresh TF info regardless of tracker working!
    - [ ] Add a system watchdog to monitor threads and processes and shutdown if important threads are failing... (like video capture)
    - [ ] K4A crashes sometimes when I start monitoring two objects... investigate queues and locks...
- [X] Ability to save image (for future trainings):
    - [X] ~~Save to temp file~~
    - [X] ~~Upload to blob~~
    - [X] ~~Save to temp file~~
- [ ] Move cloud uploader to other class...?
- [ ] Make the robot work without web scoring and without crashing.

Solved issues:
- [X] ~~Troubleshoot why video file format from XVID/AVI container won't read in browser - files generated in devcontainer work... but not in application...~~

    - [X] ~~Upload to blob in proper structure (/date/...)~~
    - [X] ~~Use logic app to send to onedrive if need be~~
- [X] ~~Move video display to its own task~~

- [X] ~~MQTT~~
- [X] ~~Async event loop~~
- [X] ~~modify code to read images for scoring via the K4A drivers~~
- [x] ~~Need to fix to get boxes > threshold... and return info to caller (via MQTT queues)~~
- [X] ~~Add support for K4A (Kinect for Azure - with Submodule)~~
- [X] ~~Need to fifx bounding boxes not following (following in reverse for the Y axis)~~

- [X] ~~Moving things around, sometimes there is an exception unable to remove a specific UUID from the list of tracked object. Investigate...~~
- [X] ~~Add that the objects that are kept monitored are ordered by scores... so if max_item = 1, we don't keep score = 60% if one has score = 80%~~
- [X] Need to understand why it's tracking more than 1 object when we tell it not to.
- [X] ~~Remove Tensorflow (remove-tensorflow branch) : ~~
- [X] ~~Run development from container (vscode-remote-container)~~
- [X] ~~Figure out distance to object... and propagate it.~~
- [X] ~~Updating not only tracking position but score as the TF scoring varies~~
- [X] Stability : 
    - [X] Distance can't be computed... need to understand why.
    - [X] ~~Need to debug processes when there are 4-5 objects... seems to get confused.~~
    - [X] ~~Abiltity to track N objects~~
    - [X] ~~Validate that we can remove all objects and they dissapear~~
    - [X] ~~Check that K4A still works all the time when removing objects.~~
    - [X] ~~Fix traceback on exit: ~~
