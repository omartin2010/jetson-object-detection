There are two components of this to be run on this piece of hardware.
1. Model Serving - see other repo for details.
2. Object Detector Robot Software

Each of these startups are described below.

## Object Detector

### Environment Variables
You need to define a few environment variables for credentials in some file... (`.env.list` or other, see `docker` command below).
```
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=...
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=...
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```
Docker command to run this. IT can be in `.xsessionrc` as this needs to be run with the session started.

```
export DISPLAY=:0;
xhost +si:localuser:root;
docker run --restart unless-stopped --privileged \
    --name objectdetector \
    --network host \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    --env-file ~/proj/objectdetector/.env.list \
    --memory 2g \
    --memory-swap 3g \
    --cpus=2.5 \
    objectdetector:latest
```
